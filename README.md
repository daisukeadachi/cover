# cover

- this repository is meant to automatically generate cover letters for academic job applications.
- direction: fill inputs (explained below) and simply execute `main.py`. cover letters are generated in `output` folder.
- inputs are `list.csv` and `info.csv`
  - `list.csv`: the most important part. list the institution, department, and position you want to apply to. you can also fill the address (optional)
  - `info.csv`: your information

## to do

- automate filling address
  - perhaps by fetching google map information
- set up a webpage with a form that accepts above inputs and return downloadable set of cover letters, ideally by `output.zip`
  - i don't know exactly how. please let me know if you know it!
- possibly include applicant's institution logo and hand-written signature (but these seem just aesthetic and minor)
