Daisuke Adachi,Yale University,Department of Economics,28 Hillhouse Ave,,,New Haven,CT,USA,+1 475-243-8266,daisuke.adachi.econ@gmail.com,June 2021,"My research interests are the intersection of International Trade and Labor Economics, particularly related to the effect of automation and globalization on employment. My doctoral dissertation explores the impact of industrial robots and multinational enterprises on labor market outcomes in the US and Japan. My findings highlight the quantitative importance of these automation and globalization on earnings inequality measured by wage inequality and factor shares. In my ongoing projects, I plan to extend my research agenda to obtain further evidence from various sources, including a uniquely designed plant-level survey."
